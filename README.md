# Titanic-Classification
The data and code in this repository may be used to forecast whether Titanic passengers will survive using machine learning methods. The well-known "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset, which is accessible on Kaggle, was utilised in this study.

Dataset Description The dataset consists of two CSV files:

train.csv: The training data that will be utilised to create and hone our prediction model is contained in this file. It contains details on a variety of passengers, including their age, gender, passenger class, number of parents, siblings, and spouses on board, amount of ticket paid, and most crucially, whether or not they survived (the goal variable).

test.csv: The test data, which we will use to test our trained model and generate predictions, are contained in this file. It has the same characteristics as the training data, but the "Survived" column, which requires prediction, is missing.

Objective of this project - The major objective of this project is to create a prediction model that can correctly forecast, based on the available information, whether a certain passenger would survive or not. To complete this goal, a variety of machine learning algorithms and methods will be used.

Acknowledgments We would like to thank Kaggle for donating the Titanic dataset, which has helped advance the machine learning industry.
This work is done under guidedance of Bharat intern.
